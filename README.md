# CodingImprovement
I'm developing a code to calculate the optimal operating points to control induction machines for electric vehicle applications. After the 3-day lesson, I see many places can be improved. 
However, it needs nonlinear solvers to crack it. My current solution is to call solvers from Matlab.  In addition, I have a dream to move all the code to Python. Let's see how far I can go by taking the chance of this course.
